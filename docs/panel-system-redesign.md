# Panel System Redesign
i
## Overview
This document proposes a comprehensive redesign of our visualization panel system to improve flexibility, user experience, and code maintainability. The new design draws inspiration from VS Code's panel management system, providing a familiar and professional interface for users.

## Background
The current panel system uses a rigid layout with fixed-size panels and basic resizing capabilities. This has led to several limitations:
- Inflexible panel arrangements
- Inconsistent resizing behavior
- Poor space utilization
- Limited user control over panel visibility
- Difficult maintenance due to tightly coupled components

## Goals
1. **Improved User Experience**
   - Collapsible panels for better space management
   - Smooth resizing with visual feedback
   - Consistent panel behavior across the application
   - VS Code-like accordion style panels

2. **Better Code Architecture**
   - Decoupled panel management from component logic
   - Type-safe panel configuration
   - Centralized panel state management
   - Improved event handling system

3. **Enhanced Flexibility**
   - Dynamic panel sizing
   - Configurable minimum dimensions
   - Persistent panel states
   - Easy addition of new panels

## Technical Design

### Panel Manager
The core of the redesign is a new `PanelManager` class that handles:
- Panel creation and destruction
- Resize events
- Collapse/expand states
- Panel configuration
- Event delegation

```typescript
interface PanelConfig {
    id: string;
    title?: string;
    minWidth?: number;
    minHeight?: number;
    collapsible?: boolean;
    flex?: string;
    onResize?: (dimensions: PanelDimensions) => void;
    onCollapse?: (collapsed: boolean) => void;
}

interface PanelDimensions {
    width: number;
    height: number;
}
```

### Panel Layout
The new layout system uses CSS Grid and Flexbox for better control:
- Vertical and horizontal panel arrangements
- Smooth transitions during resize/collapse
- Minimum size constraints
- Flex-based space distribution

### Component Integration
Components like GraphVisualization, PlotManager, and SamplingControls will be updated to:
- Accept PanelManager instance
- Use panel events for updates
- Handle panel state changes
- Manage content dimensions

### CSS Architecture
New CSS modules for:
- Panel containers and headers
- Resize handles
- Collapse/expand animations
- State-based styling

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure
1. Create PanelManager class
2. Implement basic panel management
3. Add resize functionality
4. Set up event system

### Phase 2: Component Updates
1. Refactor GraphVisualization
2. Update PlotManager
3. Modify SamplingControls
4. Implement panel state persistence

### Phase 3: UI Polish
1. Add transitions and animations
2. Implement VS Code-inspired styling
3. Add visual feedback for interactions
4. Optimize performance

## Example Usage

```typescript
// Initialize panel manager
const panelManager = new PanelManager('panels-container', [
    {
        id: 'graph-container',
    },
    {
        id: 'cpd-panel',
        title: 'Conditional Probability Table',
    },
    // ... additional panels
]);

// Initialize visualization with panel manager
const graphViz = new GraphVisualization(panelManager);
```

## Migration Strategy
1. Implement new system alongside existing code
2. Gradually migrate components to use PanelManager
3. Test thoroughly with different panel configurations
4. Remove old panel management code
5. Update documentation and examples

## Risks and Mitigations
- **Risk**: Performance impact from panel animations
  - **Mitigation**: Use CSS transforms, throttle resize events

- **Risk**: Browser compatibility issues
  - **Mitigation**: Use well-supported CSS features, add fallbacks

- **Risk**: Complex state management
  - **Mitigation**: Centralize state in PanelManager

## Success Metrics
1. Improved user feedback on panel interactions
2. Reduced code complexity
3. Faster implementation of new panel features
4. Better space utilization in the UI

## Future Considerations
1. Drag-and-drop panel rearrangement
2. Panel presets for different use cases
3. Custom panel transitions
4. Panel state persistence across sessions

## Conclusion
This redesign will significantly improve our visualization system's usability and maintainability. By drawing inspiration from VS Code's proven panel system, we can provide users with a familiar and professional interface while making the codebase more maintainable and extensible.
